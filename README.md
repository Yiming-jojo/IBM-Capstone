# IBM-Capstone

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

## Task One

We will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools we need to complete the course.

### Collecting data

1. Connect API

2. Get data part 1 csv file

3. Web - Scraping: We will be performing web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches

4. Get spacex_web_scraped.csv

### Data Wrangling 

We will perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

In this part we will mainly convert those outcomes into Training Labels with 1 means the booster successfully landed 0 means it was unsuccessful.

## Task Two: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Exploratory Analysis Using SQL



### Exploratory Analysis Using Pands and Matplotlib
